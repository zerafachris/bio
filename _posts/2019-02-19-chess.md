The Kingbase dataset, a collection of 1.8 million chess games in Portable Game Notation (PGN) format, offers a rich resource for analysing trends and patterns in chess. In this article, I present a series of visualizations developed in R to highlight key insights from this dataset, such as move concentration around specific cells, increasing game length over time, average game ply, and the advantage of playing white. These visualizations provide a unique perspective on the evolving strategies and dynamics within competitive chess.
