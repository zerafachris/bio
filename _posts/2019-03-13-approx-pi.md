In this article, I demonstrate a Monte Carlo simulation approach to approximate \(\pi\) by calculating the ratio of points within a unit circle to points in a surrounding square. The method involves randomly sampling points within a defined space and measuring their distribution relative to the circle boundary. Using Python, I iteratively increase the sample size to show how the simulationâ€™s accuracy gradually converges to the true value of \(\pi\), illustrating the Central Limit Theorem in action. The code calculates approximations of \(\pi\), displays results for varying sample sizes, and visualizes convergence through error analysis, providing a clear example of Monte Carlo simulation in practice.
