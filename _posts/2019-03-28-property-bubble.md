The Maltese property market has garnered increasing attention as property prices surge to unprecedented levels, sparking widespread debate about whether we are experiencing a property bubble. While countless news articles and opinions flood the media landscape, these often offer contrasting and sometimes conflicting views on the state of the market. A simple search will reveal arguments both for and against the presence of a bubble, each bringing a new layer of complexity and, sometimes, sensationalism. In this article, I take a data-driven approach to examine the Maltese property market objectively, aiming to quantify whether a property bubble truly exists without the influence of media noise. Using a structured analysis in Excel, I explore key indicators and patterns to assess the market's condition. By analyzing empirical data directly, we aim to deliver clear insights that transcend the typical media narratives, providing a grounded view of Maltaâ€™s property market.
