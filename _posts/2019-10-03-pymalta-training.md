As part of my ongoing efforts to promote data science and machine learning in Malta, I had the pleasure of organizing two educational events for the **PyMalta** group in 2019. These sessions aimed to introduce attendees to the fundamentals of machine learning (ML) and provide them with hands-on experience through practical exercises. The events were held in collaboration with various local organizations and were designed to engage participants of all experience levels.

## Session 1: First Steps Towards Machine Learning (Part 1)
- **Date:** 2019-09-26
- **Location:** Binary Offices

### Event Overview

The first session of the series, "First Steps Towards Machine Learning (Part 1)," was designed as an introductory workshop to help attendees understand the basics of machine learning and how to begin implementing it in Python. I started by explaining the fundamental concept of machine learning: teaching a computer to recognize patterns in data in a similar way humans learn from experience.

### Key Topics Covered

- **Intro to Machine Learning:**  
  I explained that machine learning is the process of training computers to find patterns in large data sets, something humans are typically slow at but computers excel at. I used a simple one-dimensional data set to illustrate how we model data and use machine learning to make predictions.

- **Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning:**  
  We explored the difference between supervised learning, where the model learns from labeled data, and unsupervised learning, where the model identifies patterns without predefined labels. This section included relatable examples, such as the analogy of borrowing books from a library to learn about two subjects, math and geography.

- **Introduction to Scikit-learn:**  
  Participants were introduced to **Scikit-learn**, the most widely used Python library for machine learning. We discussed how Scikit-learn implements algorithms as classes and how users can interact with these models to create machine learning workflows.

- **Supervised Machine Learning for Classification:**  
  Using the Titanic dataset, participants learned how to build a classification model to predict survival likelihood. The session included discussions on evaluation metrics like **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score** to assess model performance.

- **Challenges in Machine Learning:**  
  We discussed common issues, such as bias and overfitting, and how to address them. I emphasized that machine learning is not a one-size-fits-all solution and that it's important to ensure that models generalize well beyond the data they were trained on.

- **Metrics for Classification Models:**  
  A detailed explanation of classification metrics was provided, using examples like disease detection, where precision and recall are more important than accuracy.

### Learning Outcomes

By the end of the session, attendees had a solid understanding of the foundational concepts of machine learning, how to implement basic models using Scikit-learn, and how to evaluate them using appropriate metrics.

## Session 2: PyMalta: First Steps Towards Machine Learning (Part 2)
- **Date:** 2019-10-03
- **Location:** GiG Beach

### Event Overview

The second session, "First Steps Towards Machine Learning (Part 2)," was a follow-up to the first, focused on reinforcing the concepts introduced in the first session through hands-on exercises. Held in a more relaxed setting at GiG Beach, the event provided participants with a chance to apply their knowledge in practical scenarios.

### Key Activities and Exercises

- **Practical Exercises:**  
  Participants worked through a series of exercises designed to deepen their understanding of machine learning algorithms and data preprocessing techniques. These activities included building more complex models and applying them to new datasets, as well as exploring feature scaling, data transformation, and handling missing data.

- **Interactive Learning:**  
  The session included interactive discussions where participants could share their challenges and solutions while working on the exercises. This collaborative environment allowed them to learn from each other and refine their understanding of key concepts like overfitting, underfitting, and model selection.

- **Real-World Applications:**  
  I introduced case studies where machine learning has been successfully applied to solve problems in various industries. This helped attendees understand the practical impact of the skills they were acquiring.

- **Introduction to More Advanced Topics:**  
  Towards the end of the session, we touched on more advanced machine learning topics, including decision trees and other classification algorithms, preparing participants for future learning.

### Learning Outcomes

The session reinforced the skills learned in the first part and enabled participants to gain confidence in implementing machine learning models. They also had the opportunity to explore more advanced concepts and gain hands-on experience with real-world datasets.

## Conclusion

Both sessions of the **First Steps Towards Machine Learning** series were a great success, with a wide range of attendees gaining valuable insights into the world of machine learning. The events were not only an opportunity to learn about ML but also to network with like-minded individuals and contribute to the growing data science community in Malta. These sessions were an excellent introduction to machine learning, and I look forward to hosting more events in the future to continue empowering professionals and enthusiasts in the field.
