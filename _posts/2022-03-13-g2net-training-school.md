In March 2020, I had the privilege of organizing an international training school as part of the [g2net](https://indico.ego-gw.it/event/46/) CA17137 network for Gravitational Waves, Geophysics, and Machine Learning (G2Net). Hosted in Malta, this event brought together experts from diverse fields to explore the intersection of gravitational wave physics, geophysics, and advanced computing techniques. The training school was designed to enhance the understanding and application of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) to solve complex problems in gravitational wave astronomy.

## Training School Objectives

The main objective of the training school was to bring together scientists with expertise in gravitational wave physics, geophysics, and computing science. The goal was to tackle critical challenges in data analysis and noise characterization for gravitational wave detectors, an area that has become crucial since the groundbreaking discovery of gravitational waves in 2015. With a focus on the latest advancements in ML and DL, participants learned how these techniques could be applied to handle vast and complex data sets, improve control systems for next-generation detectors, and address issues such as noise removal and data conditioning.

## Lecture Modules

The training school offered a robust curriculum through a series of specialized modules, each addressing key aspects of the field:
- **Signal Processing:** Techniques for processing and interpreting gravitational wave data.
- **Time Series Analysis:** Understanding and analyzing time-dependent data from seismic signals and gravitational wave observations.
- **Machine Learning & Deep Learning:** Exploring the role of ML and DL in enhancing data analysis for gravitational wave research.
- **Gravitational Waves:** In-depth lectures on the physics of gravitational waves, their detection, and the challenges involved.
- **Geophysics:** Addressing the impact of seismic noise and geophysical phenomena on gravitational wave detection.

## Hackathon: Skill Assessment and Collaboration

A central part of the training school was the hackathon, which was organized to assess the practical skills and knowledge of participants. The hackathon provided an opportunity for attendees to collaborate in teams, applying the concepts they had learned throughout the training modules to real-world data sets and challenges. Teams were tasked with tackling specific problems related to data analysis, noise suppression, or the application of machine learning techniques to gravitational wave detection. This hands-on activity not only tested participants’ abilities to work with complex data but also fostered teamwork and interdisciplinary collaboration, as participants with different areas of expertise came together to find innovative solutions.

## Conclusion

Reflecting on the success of the G2Net training school, I gained valuable insights into the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration in solving complex scientific challenges. The event not only enhanced participants’ skills but also contributed to the broader goals of the CA17137 network, which continues to play a pivotal role in advancing research in gravitational wave science and related fields.
