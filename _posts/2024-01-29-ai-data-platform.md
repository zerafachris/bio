This project showcases an end-to-end data engineering system designed to handle real-time data for AI applications, with a specific use case in an online iGaming casino. The system integrates multiple tools to capture, process, store, and analyze streaming data efficiently, enabling real-time insights and AI model integration. Key components include Apache Airflow for workflow orchestration, Apache Kafka for data streaming, and ClickHouse for fast real-time analytics. Faust processes streaming data, while Feast serves as a feature store for AI models. Grafana and Superset provide powerful visualization tools, and Node-RED facilitates workflow integration. This flexible system architecture is adaptable to various industries, including e-commerce, finance, healthcare, and smart cities. Use case scenarios such as real-time player behavior analysis in casinos, fraud detection in finance, and traffic management in smart cities illustrate the systemâ€™s scalability and versatility for real-time data processing and actionable insights across diverse domains.
