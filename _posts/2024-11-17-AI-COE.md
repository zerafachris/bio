Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping industries, driving efficiencies, and enabling innovation at scale. However, its success depends not just on the technology itself but also on how organizations structure and implement their AI strategies. For medium to large organizations, a critical component for achieving AI scalability and alignment is tahe **Center of Excellence (CoE)** model. 

An AI CoE serves as a centralized hub where expertise, tools, and resources are pooled to drive AI initiatives efficiently. It establishes best practices, enables cross-functional collaboration, and ensures that AI efforts align with broader organizational objectives. By combining central oversight with decentralized execution through business units, the CoE model provides the structure necessary to scale AI effectively.

Two main types of AI organizations leverage CoEs in different ways:
- **AI-driven organizations**, where AI is the core business enabler, use CoEs to lead disruptive innovation and product development.
- **AI-enabled organizations** integrate AI into existing operations, relying on CoEs to enhance efficiency, optimize processes, and improve decision-making.

Without an effective AI CoE, organizations risk duplication of efforts, inefficient resource allocation, and disconnected use cases. By establishing a CoE as part of a broader AI strategy, organizations can overcome these challenges and unlock the transformative potential of AI. 

In this article, I would like to present an AI CoE model for a gaming company. The proposed model will serve as a high-level strategy for the AI/ML department, encompassing a vision, mission, organizational structure, and a phased approach to implementing the CoE. It is assumed that data teams already exist within the organization. The AI CoE will act as a unifying structure to democratize AI and ML across product development teams, accelerating delivery, fostering domain expertise, and scaling operations effectively. 


## An AI CoE for an Organisation
