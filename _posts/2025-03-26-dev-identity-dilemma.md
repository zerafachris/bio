The software engineering profession is facing a profound identity dilemma. For decades, developers have prided themselves on being creators—architects of code, problem solvers, and builders of digital solutions. However, the rapid rise of artificial intelligence (AI) coding tools is challenging this self-perception, transforming the role of engineers from hands-on builders to overseers and orchestrators. This shift raises fundamental questions about the future of the profession and its core identity.

## **From Builders to Managers: The AI Transformation**

Software engineers have long identified with the craft of coding. The joy of solving complex problems, optimising algorithms, and crafting elegant solutions has been central to the profession. Yet, as AI tools like GitHub Copilot and OpenAI’s Codex become increasingly capable, they are taking over much of the routine and even creative aspects of coding.

Mark Zuckerberg[^1] recently stated that AI will soon replace mid-level engineers, predicting that these tools will handle much of the work traditionally done by human developers. He is not alone in this belief; many tech leaders foresee a future where software engineering is less about writing code and more about managing AI systems to achieve desired outcomes.

This evolution is already underway. Google[^2] reports that AI generates over 25% of its new code, while Y Combinator startups claim that up to 95% of their code is now written by AI. Developers are spending less time on traditional coding and more time on "prompt engineering"—the art of communicating effectively with AI to produce desired results. This shift from crafting code to crafting prompts has sparked an identity crisis among engineers.

## **The Joy We Risk Losing**

For many developers, coding is more than a job; it’s a deeply personal craft. The satisfaction of debugging an elusive issue, optimising a slow process, or refactoring messy legacy code into something clean and maintainable is irreplaceable. These moments are not just professional achievements; they are expressions of creativity and mastery.

However, as AI takes over these tasks, developers are being pushed into roles that resemble management—defining intent, overseeing systems, and ensuring quality rather than directly building solutions. While these skills are valuable, they lack the hands-on satisfaction that many engineers cherish.

## **A Historical Parallel: Lessons from the Industrial Revolution**

This identity crisis is not unique to software engineering. During the Industrial Revolution, crafts people faced a similar challenge as machines replaced traditional skills. Many adapted by becoming specialists who operated or improved these machines, finding new ways to apply their expertise.

Likewise, modern software engineers must adapt to this AI-driven transformation. The core purpose of engineering—solving problems and creating value—remains unchanged. What is evolving are the tools and methods used to achieve these goals.

## **The Expanding Role of Software Engineers**

Rather than contracting, the definition of "software engineer" is expanding. Engineers are now expected to excel in areas like systems thinking, communication, and problem definition—skills traditionally associated with management. This evolution creates opportunities for those willing to embrace change.

AI tools can also be empowering. They enable rapid prototyping, accelerate learning, and handle routine tasks, allowing developers to focus on higher-level challenges. For junior engineers or those re-entering the field, these tools can serve as mentors, boosting confidence and capability.

## **Finding Balance in a Changing Landscape**

The key challenge for software engineers is finding balance in this new landscape. Some will thrive as orchestrators of AI systems, focusing on high-level design and efficiency. Others will continue to find fulfilment in domains where human expertise remains essential—such as security-critical systems or novel applications where AI lacks training data.

Ultimately, adaptability will be the most valuable skill in this evolving field. By embracing change while preserving core values like creativity and problem-solving, software engineers can redefine their roles without losing their sense of identity.

## **Conclusion**

The rise of AI in software engineering presents both challenges and opportunities. While it threatens traditional notions of craftsmanship, it also opens doors to new ways of working and thinking. By viewing this transformation through the lens of history and focusing on adaptability, engineers can navigate this identity crisis with confidence.

The future may look different from the past, but one thing remains clear: software engineers will continue to play a vital role in shaping technology—and society—for years to come.
